# Module 15 Challenge

In this challenge we use JavaScript and Leaflet to create an interactive map that plots eartquake data using the USGS GeoJSON API. The map displays eqarthquake markets, that are colored by depth and sized by magnitude.

The logic.js file contains the code for the application, and the style.css contains styling information for the map and legend.

# Resources Used

XpertLearning system was used to help create the legend and CSS styling needed for legend to appear on map.
